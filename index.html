      <h2>NUMIC WEBSITE</h2>
      <br>
      <h4><i>What You Know To Build A Website</i></h4>
      <br>
      <p class="colo" style="font-size: 20px;">Websites come in a nearly endless variety, including educational sites, news sites, porn sites, forums, social media sites, e-commerce sites, and so on. The pages within a website are usually a mix of text and other media. That said, there are no rules dictating the form of a website.
        <br><br>
        A person could create a website of nothing but black and white photos of roses, or the word "cat" linked to another Web page with the word "mouse." However, many sites follow a standard pattern of a homepage that links off to other categories and content within the website.
        <br><br>
        The homepage (or simply “home”) represents the main page of the site itself. Frequently, the homepage is a sort of “hub” from which all other pages can be accessed. An internal web page to which several other pages are linked in a coherent structure (such as a specific category of topics) is instead called a “parent page.”
        <br><br>
        Every page is a single HTML document, and all of them are connected through hyperlinks (or simply “link”) which can be combined in a navigation bar for ease of use.
        <br><br>
        The navigation bar is displayed on every page rather than just the homepage, and allows the user to quickly move across the main website’s structure.
        <br><br>
        Another important section of most websites is the footer, which is another recurring section that is found at the bottom of every page. Usually the footer contains external links pointing to similar websites and other external resources, together with other vital info such as disclaimers, links to the terms of service, privacy policy and contact pages, as well as the physical address of the company that owns the site.
        <br><br>
        Components of a Website: We know that a website is a collection of a webpages hosted on a web-server. These are the components for making a website.
        <br><br>
          <strong>Hosting:</strong> is the location where the website is physically located. Group of webpages (linked webpages) licensed to be called a website only when the webpage is hosted on the webserver. The webserver is a set of files transmitted to user computers when they specify the website’s address..
          <br><br>
          <strong>Address:</strong> Address of a website also knows as the URL of a website. When a user wants to open a website then they need to put the address or URL of the website into the web browser, and the asked website is delivered by the webserver.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Homepage :</strong> Home page is a very common and important part of a webpage. It is the first webpage that appears when a visitor visits the website. The home page of a website is very important as it sets the look and feel of the website and directs viewers to the rest of the pages on the website.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Design :</strong> It is the final and overall look and feel of the website that has a result of proper use and integration elements like navigation menus, graphics, layout, navigation menus etc.
          Content : Every web pages contained on the website together make up the content of the website. Good content on the webpages makes the website more effective and attractive.
          <br><br>
          The Navigation Structure: The navigation structure of a website is the order of the pages, the collection of what links to what. Usually, it is held together by at least one navigation menu.
          <br><br>
          How to access Websites?
          When we type a certain URL in a browser search bar, the browser requests the page from the Web server and the Web server returns the required web page and its content to the browser. Now, it differs from how the server returns the information required in the case of static and dynamic websites.
          <br><br>
          Types of Website:
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong class="tag">- Static Website
          <br><br>
          - Dynamic Website</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Static Website:</strong> In Static Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites. Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. There is no interaction with databases. Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Dynamic Website:</strong> In Dynamic Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which is processed during runtime means they are not prebuilt web pages, but they are built during runtime according to the user’s demand with the help of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more supported by the server. So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible. Dynamic Websites are used over Static Websites as updates can be done very easily as compared to static websites (Where altering in every page is required) but in Dynamic Websites, it is possible to do a common change once, and it will reflect in all the web pages.
